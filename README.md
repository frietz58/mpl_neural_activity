# What is this?
Repo contains script that produce relatively complex animations (see examples in `animations` folder) of hidden activations of different types of continuous 
time recurrent neural networks. 

# Installation
1. Clone the repo: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/frietz58/mpl_neural_activity.git
```
2. Install requirements: 
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Done. Run `video_freqpred_3x4_trace.py` or `video_ptb_trace.py` to produce the animations as in 
the `animations` folder.

For more information on these specific animations, check out https://www.finnrietz.dev/projects/mpl_animate/.
